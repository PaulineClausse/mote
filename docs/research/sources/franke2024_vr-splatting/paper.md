Fig. 1. VR-Splatting combines advantages of neural point rendering [Franke et al. 2024] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [Kerbl et al. 2023] within a hybrid foveated radiance field rendering system for VR. In contrast to 3DGS and a VR-ready variant, which only uses 0.5 Mio. primitives (see Fig. 2), our method provides high fidelity in the foveal region and meets the 90 Hz VR framerate requirements at 2016 × 2240 pixels per eye.

Recent advances in novel view synthesis have demonstrated impressive results in fast photorealistic scene rendering through differentiable point rendering, either via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [Kerbl et al. 2023] or neural point rendering [Aliev et al. 2020]. Unfortunately, these directions require either a large number of small Gaussians or expensive per-pixel post-processing for reconstructing fine details, which negatively impacts rendering performance. To meet the high performance demands of virtual reality (VR) systems, primitive or pixel counts therefore must be kept low, affecting visual quality.

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on foveated rendering as a promising solution that combines the strengths of both point rendering directions regarding performance sweet spots. Analyzing the compatibility with the human visual system, we find that using a low-detailed, few primitive smooth Gaussian representation for the periphery is cheap to compute and meets the perceptual demands of peripheral vision. For the fovea only, we use neural points with a convolutional neural network for the small pixel footprint, which provides sharp, detailed output within the rendering budget. This combination also allows for synergistic method accelerations with point occlusion culling and reducing the demands on the neural network.

Our evaluation confirms that our approach increases sharpness and details compared to a standard VR-ready 3DGS configuration, and participants of a user study overwhelmingly preferred our method. Our system meets the necessary performance requirements for real-time VR interactions, ultimately enhancing the user’s immersive experience.

## 1 Introduction

Virtual teleportation into real-world environments, displayed on a virtual reality (VR) headset is a long-standing goal in computer graphics and computer vision. State-of-the-art VR headsets exhibit high-resolution and high-refresh-rate displays, which place high and strict performance demands on rendering algorithms.

In light of this, we propose a novel radiance field rendering method that allows interactive virtual scene exploration. We meet the high performance demands by exploiting the visual acuity falloff in the periphery through foveated rendering. Most foveated rendering algorithms render the foveal region as sharp and crisp as possible while trying to cut computational costs in the periphery by, e.g., lowering the resolution [Guenter et al. 2012] or the number of rays traced [Weier et al. 2016]. However, the application of such techniques is not trivial as they cause side effects such as temporal instability or flickering, to which the peripheral vision is highly sensitive [Weier et al. 2017].

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [Kerbl et al. 2023] emerged as a volumetric scene representation for fast and realistic novel view synthesis. Its volumetric nature inherently produces smooth renderings, and it lacks aliasing due to alpha blending the primitives as well as low-pass filtering before rasterization. However, to achieve pleasing results with crisp details, the required number of Gaussian primitives pushes the framerates below acceptable levels for VR, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 (a). On the other hand, neural point rendering-based methods, like TRIPS [Franke et al. 2024], promise sharper results for the same time budgets. They use neural networks as sophisticated image filters that interpret colors from rasterized neural point colors (often called descriptors) and jointly fill holes originating from projecting small-sized point splats. Both it and 3DGS use a Lagrangian scene representation, but model the splat sizes in different ways: 3DGS models splat

size in Euclidean space via variance parameters, while the size of neural points is interpreted in pixel space using a neural network.

This causes the rendering performance to scale differently. 3DGS requires tiling and sorting all primitives; as such, the rendering speed of 3DGS is reduced with an increasing number of primitives. In contrast, neural point rendering methods rasterize millions of primitives fast but are highly sensitive to resolution increases due to the convolutional neural network (CNN) employed for screen-space filtering. Fig. 2 illustrates this behavior. Unfortunately, both methods do not meet VR framerate requirements when used with full resolution and their default number of primitives.

In this juxtaposition, we identify a sweet spot matching foveated rendering: For the fovea, neural point rendering is able to cheaply render high-detailed, crisp small image crops. In particular, TRIPS has shown to be able to render fine details accurately (as seen in Fig. 3), which is advantageous for perceived quality given the magnification effects of current VR headset lenses. Regarding the periphery, Gaussian Splatting even with reduced number of primitives perfectly harmonizes with the demands of peripheral vision for high coherence and low flickering, as it renders a smooth but low detailed image which is temporally stable.

Instead of a purely 3DGS-based method, which reduces the number of primitives in the periphery, we opt for such a hybrid approach that marries the individual advantages of the chosen methods regarding fovea and periphery reconstruction. In this paper, we thus introduce a hybrid system, which also allows us to further accelerate the system through synergies.

Given a VR headset with integrated eye tracking, our method first renders a low-detailed Gaussian rendering for both eyes for the full field of view. Hereby, we find that pixel-correct sorting [Radl et al. 2024] proves vital for rendering smoothly. Using a occlusion estimation from this rendering together with querying the eye tracker, we cull the neural point cloud and rasterize it into an image pyramid for the foveal regions pixel footprint. This pyramid, together with the cropped Gaussian rendering, is then resolved with a small CNN, allowing the network to focus on adding fine detail in the foveal area only. The results of both renderings are then combined and sent to the VR headset.

Our novel Gaussian and neural point representation is optimized from captured input images end-to-end, allowing virtual walk-throughs through real-world environments. We contribute:

• A high-fidelity, 90 Hz capable technique using foveated radiance fields rendering for firstperson VR rendering.

• The combination of neural point rendering and Gaussian rendering techniques for crisp foveal and smooth peripheral rendering.

• An evaluation of our foveated rendering method, including a user study showing its effectiveness.

## 2.1 Foveated Rendering

Exploiting the limitations of the human visual system (HVS) is a well established approach to relax rendering constraints and reduce computational demands [Wang et al. 2023; Weier et al. 2017].

The Human Visual System. A key characteristic of human vision is the decrease in visual acuity in our peripheral vision, which foveated rendering techniques leverage. Weier et al. [2017] provide a comprehensive overview of the HVS and its exploitable limitations.

For designing rendering algorithms, the retina’s physiology is crucial. The retina contains cones and rods that respond to light stimuli. The cones, mainly concentrated in the fovea (less than $1 0 ^ { \circ }$ of the visual field), are responsible for sharp, color vision [Goldstein and Brockmole 2016]. Rods, on the contrary, are motion sensitive and less color sensitive, dominating the peripheral retina with the highest concentration around $1 7 ^ { \circ }$ from the gaze direction [Curcio et al. 1990]. This distribution allows the human visual system to be modeled with a foveal region (fovea) for sharp vision and a peripheral region (periphery) sensitive primarily to brightness and motion. Exploiting this model to accelerate the rendering is called foveated rendering. Sometimes, it is assumed that the users gaze is always centered on the image, then called fixed foveated rendering. However, this assumption has failure cases and usually requires the foveal region to extend much larger than with eye-tracked methods. In this work, we employ eye tracking, as this allows us to keep the foveal region small and achieve better performance.

Foveated Synthetic Rendering. The concept of foveated rendering has been extensively investigated in the context of synthetic, artist-created scene rendering [Jabbireddy et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023]. Guenter et al. [2012] proposed generating three images per frame with full resolution in the fovea and progressively lower resolution in the periphery, blending them using bilinear upsampling. Nevertheless, this requires robust anti-aliasing to mitigate flickering, which can be reduced by decoupling visibility detection from shading [Patney et al. 2016].

Adaptive sampling in foveated ray tracing [Koskela et al. 2016] also reduces the computational load by focusing more samples on the fovea and fewer on the periphery [Friston et al. 2019; Stengel et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2017; Weier et al. 2016]. Stengel et al. [2016] use saliency maps to allocate samples effectively, while Weier et al. [2016] employ a reprojection scheme to accelerate ray tracing by resampling only visually important areas in the periphery, an idea also transferred to rasterization [Franke et al. 2021]. Other techniques include log-polar mappings for cost reduction [Meng et al. 2020b, 2018], contrast-aware foveation for ray tracing and rasterization [Tursun et al. 2019] and deep foveated reconstruction trained with video [Kaplanyan et al. 2019] or neural super resolution techniques [Ye et al. 2024b].

Further supporting research has explored methods to reduce perceptual artifacts. For example, adding depth of field [Weier et al. 2018], developing perceptual image metrics [Mantiuk et al. 2022, 2021; Swafford et al. 2016], exploring saliency [Sitzmann et al. 2018], exploiting eye domination [Meng et al. 2020a], hardware solutions [Kim et al. 2019] and examining peripheral acuity [Hoffman et al. 2018] have all proofed promising. Eye-tracking latency requirements [Albert et al. 2017] suggest that a maximum latency of 50-70 ms is acceptable to avoid noticing artifacts, particularly during rapid eye movements (saccades).

## 2.2 Radiance Field Rendering

Radiance fields are a common set of representations for novel view synthesis (NVS), by which new views are created from angles previously unseen.

Traditional Methods. Traditionally, NVS relied on light fields [Gortler et al. 1996], but image-based rendering, often by warping source views onto geometric proxies [Debevec et al. 1998] has since emerged as a popular alternative [Shum and Kang 2000]. Although this rendering can be performed fast and efficiently, quality is highly dependent on the quality of the proxy geometry, although subsequent methods have sought to mitigate these issues [Chaurasia et al. 2013; Eisemann et al. 2008]. Full 3D reconstructions, which gained traction with the advent of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) [Schönberger and Frahm 2016; Snavely et al. 2006] and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) [Goesele et al. 2007; Schönberger et al. 2016; Seitz et al. 2006], also suffer from similar issues. Although requiring significantly more render time, neural rendering extensions [Tewari et al. 2022] employing learned blending operators [Hedman et al. 2018] and deep learned textures [Thies et al. 2019] in NVS strongly increase quality.

Neural Radiance Fields. More recently, implicit 3D scene representations using volumetric fields have become popular, enabling novel view synthesis through volume rendering without requiring proxy geometry. The Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) introduced by Mildenhall et al. [2020] has shown remarkable results by encoding entire 3D scenes into a coordinate-based MLP. Subsequent research has addressed challenges related to input view distributions [Chibane et al. 2021; Kopanas and Drettakis 2023; Wu et al. 2024a; Yu et al. 2021b], scaling [Mi and Xu 2023; Tancik et al. 2022; Turki et al. 2022] and computation times [Barron et al. 2021, 2022, 2023; Chen et al. 2021; Chibane et al. 2021; Müller et al. 2022; Neff et al. 2021; Tancik et al. 2021]. Effective strategies include scene space discretization through voxel grids [Fridovich-Keil et al. 2022], octrees [Rückert et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2021a], tensor decomposition [Chen et al. 2022], and faster model inference through neurally textured triangle meshes [Chen et al. 2023] or mesh baking [Duckworth et al. 2024; Reiser et al. 2024, 2023; Yariv et al. 2023]. Notably, Müller et al. [2022] achieved significant improvements in training and rendering speed using a hash grid-based space partitioning scheme, allowing fast training and framerates of up to 10 fps.

Point-based Radiance Fields. Compared to NeRFs, point-based radiance fields require an explicit point cloud proxy captured from LiDAR [Liao et al. 2022], RGB-D cameras with depth fusion [Dai et al. 2017; Keller et al. 2013; Whelan et al. 2016] or estimated through SfM or MVS. Point clouds represent an unstructured set of spatial samples with varying distances between neighbors, closely reflecting the original captured data. Rendering these point clouds is highly efficient [Schütz et al. 2021, 2022, 2019], and when augmented with neural descriptors [Aliev et al. 2020; Franke et al. 2023, 2024; Hahlbohm et al. 2025a, 2023; Kappel et al. 2024; Rakhimov et al. 2022; Rückert et al. 2022] or as a proxy for optimized attributes [Kopanas et al. 2022, 2021], they can produce high-quality images using differentiable point renderers [Wiles et al. 2020; Yifan et al. 2019] or neural ray-based renderers [Abou-Chakra et al. 2024; Ost et al. 2022; Xu et al. 2022].

A significant issue in point rendering is filling the gaps in the rendered images, which has led to the development of two main approaches: world-space splatting and screen-space hole filling [Kobbelt and Botsch 2004]. In world-space splatting, points are rendered as oriented discs or 3D structures, known as "splats" or "surfels", with radii precomputed based on point cloud density. To minimize artifacts, these splats are often combined using Gaussian alpha masks and normalizing blend functions [Alexa et al. 2004; Pfister et al. 2000; Zwicker et al. 2001]. Recent innovations in this area include optimizing splat sizes [Kerbl et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2022] and employing neural networks to improve rendering quality [Yang et al. 2020]. The primary radiance field methology using splats is 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [Kerbl et al. 2023], which sparked a plethora of subsequent work [Chen and Wang 2024; Wu et al. 2024b], including algorithmic extensions [Hahlbohm et al. 2025b; Huang et al. 2024a; Kheradmand et al. 2024; Mallick et al. 2024; Radl et al. 2024; Yu et al. 2024], large-scale variants [Kerbl et al. 2024; Ren et al. 2024], robotics [Meyer et al. 2024], and

dynamic content [Huang et al. 2023; Luiten et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2023]. These methods are able to render high-quality content at high framerates.

Screen-space hole filling commonly uses small splats at most a few pixels large and fills the resulting sparse image in screen space [Aliev et al. 2020]. Therefore, a deep filter is commonly used, in the form of a U-Net [Aliev et al. 2020], possibly adapted with Fourier convolution blocks [Hahlbohm et al. 2025a; Zhu et al. 2024] or a decoder-only CNN [Franke et al. 2024]. Extensions in this domain include reflection models [Kopanas et al. 2022], scene optimization [Franke et al. 2023; Hahlbohm et al. 2025a, 2023; Zhu et al. 2024], reduced training regimes [Harrer et al. 2023; Rakhimov et al. 2022], modeling photometric properties and lens distortion [Rückert et al. 2022], and linear splatting formulations [Franke et al. 2024; Hahlbohm et al. 2025a].

VR and Foveated Radiance Field Rendering. Radiance field rendering methods for VR are sparse, especially due to rendering budget constraints exceeding common methods.

In the domain of NeRFs, FoV-NeRF [Deng et al. 2022] introduces an egocentric NeRF variant with adapted sampling schemes for foveated rendering using multiple MLPs. Shi et al. [2024] extend this with a scene-aware formulation, whereby they improve the expressiveness for detailed areas. Wang et al. [2024] further augment this field with a voxel-based representation including a visual sensitivity model. These three approaches inherit the challenging inference performance characteristics of NeRFs, as framerates stays below 90 Hz. Similarly, hash grid NeRF-based superresolution techniques [Li et al. 2022] and variable rate shading approaches [Rolff et al. 2023a,b] achieve impressive results, but still fall short of the high framerate and resolution requirements of VR rendering. Consequently, Xu et al. [2023] introduce a multi-gpu rendering scheme, allowing 36 fps when using three A40 GPUs. Additionally, they rely on a space-carving scheme to lower ray-marching costs. Following, Turki et al. [2024] extend this with a hybrid representation reducing rendering costs for surfaces and only using full ray-marching for challenging regions.

Point-based methods also struggle with VR capabilities. Neural point-based methods such as ADOP [Rückert et al. 2022] enable VR rendering, however only for low resolution output. Likewise, the recently published official SIBR [Bonopera et al. 2020]-based VR implementation, as well as Gaussian Splatting extensions for Unity and Unreal, fail to render high-resolution details due to the amount of Gaussians required. Although some methods focus on VR applications [Jiang et al. 2024], they do not prioritize rendering efficiency.

In our method, we present the first method focusing on achieving high fidelity and fast VR rendering of radiance fields on consumer-grade hardware.

## 3 Method

As input, we use a set of real-world images captured using, e.g., a smartphone or DSLR camera. For our method, we use SfM/MVS [Schönberger and Frahm 2016; Schönberger et al. 2016] to obtain camera intrinsics, poses, and point clouds. We first present and evaluate the method core (Sec. 3.1), motivating the refinements with more sophisticated peripheral rendering (Sec. 3.2), accelerated foveal rendering (Sec. 3.3), and a fovea and edge-based combination function (Sec. 3.4). Our pipeline can be seen in Fig. 5 and is optimized end-to-end from the input images, camera parameters, and point clouds (Sec. 3.5).

## 3.1 Pilot Study

The core idea is a deftly blend of Gaussian splats and neural points for foveated rendering. Similar to Patney et al. [2016] using a perceptual sandbox, we first implemented a simplistic form of this combination and evaluated it with a pilot study, in order to evaluate the potential of the idea and to identify problems that require further refinement. First, we present and discuss the findings of this

first naive baseline. Subsequently, we continue with the description of our final system, including a number of improvements, which we developed based on the study findings.

Naive Method. To render a view, we render the point cloud in a foveated fashion, using fixation point information obtained from the VR headset’s eye tracker.

For the periphery, we employ 3D Gaussian Splatting [Kerbl et al. 2023]. Each splat has an opacity 𝛼 and a color 𝐶. Their 3D orientation and scaling are parameterized per point via a covariance matrix Σ. These primitives are projected and blended to screen, resulting in a full-resolution image 𝑃. For the study, the splats were initialized from SfM and densified carefully during training to ensure low rendering cost, resulting in 0.4 million primitives.

For the foveal region, we employ TRIPS [Franke et al. 2024] initialized with a dense point cloud estimated by MVS. Each point has contribution size 𝑠 and a compressed neural feature 𝜏. The features essentially represent colors; however, their higher dimensionality allows encoding additional information. The points are projected and blended into a multi-resolution image pyramid, based on the projected size 𝑠 [Franke et al. 2024] and then combined by a small CNN, resulting in a fovea-sized image 𝐹 . For the pilot study, 𝑃 and 𝐹 were combined using a smooth blending function and the fovea size was set to 17◦.

The parameters of Gaussians, neural points and CNN are optimized end-to-end with gradient descent from the input images with their respective proposed optimization functions.

Pilot Study. We asked four computer graphics experts (aged 23-28, 1 female, 3 male) with VR experience for their observations and rankings on a VR-ready 3DGS version with 0.5M primitives (denoted as VRGS) and contrasted it with our naive baseline on the popular Garden scene from the MipNeRF-360 dataset [Barron et al. 2022].

The participants were asked to state their most important visual observations. Consistent for both stimuli, participants noticed distracting "popping" artifacts, caused by inaccurate depth sorting in 3DGS, as noted by Radl and Steiner et al. [2024]. An example is shown in Fig. 4. The effect is amplified by the magnification of the VR headset’s lenses and the reduced number of primitives.

Regarding VRGS, participants noted blurred splotches due to underreconstruction with the reduced number of Gaussians [Ye et al. 2024a]. More blurriness compared to the foveated method was also pointed out, which coincides with observations from prior works [Franke et al. 2024; Hahlbohm et al. 2025a].

For our foveated method, the quality of the visual experience was rated slightly lower compared to VRGS. Although some mentioned increased detail richness, the experience was overshadowed by artifacts. Several things were mentioned: mismatching color palettes as the VGG-loss used by

Fig. 5. Our Pipeline. A smooth color image and approximate depth map are rendered from a limited set of 3D Gaussians with a temporally stable sorting active (see Section 3.2). Afterwards the eye tracking system is queried to construct a subfrustum via an adapted projection matrix covering only the foveal region. We project a separate neural point cloud with the adapted matrix. Points occluded by the denser Gaussian splats, are culled against the approximate depth maps and the result is processed by a small CNN (see Section 3.3). Eventually, we blend the peripheral color output and the foveal region using an egde-aware mask (see Section 3.4).

Franke et al. [2024] is known to not force color fidelity [Zuo and Deng 2023]. Furthermore, the suboptimal response of eye tracking due to delays and blinking was criticized. Lastly, noise and temporal jittering was mentioned, also noted in related work [Aliev et al. 2020; Rückert et al. 2022].

The study confirmed that the performance cuts of the VR-ready version of Gaussian Splatting lead to apparent artifacts due to underreconstruction. Although the experience of the naive foveated implementation was lacking for users, it was rated at a similar quality level. However, the experts critique showed that combining peripheral and foveal regions from two different representations is non-trivial.

Based on these findings, we identify three improvements: smoother Gaussian reconstruction for peripheral regions without popping artifacts (Sec. 3.2), fast foveal reconstruction with wellintegrated eye tracking (Sec. 3.3), and a coherent mixture of the models including a matching color palette and subtle blending of high-frequency detail (Secs. 3.4 and 3.5). Our resulting pipeline can be seen in Fig. 5.

## 3.2 Peripheral Rendering

We identify three key properties which are required for our Gaussian-based peripheral reconstruction: (1) high rendering performance, (2) little-to-no popping artifacts, and (3) little underreconstruction. Usually, these three are conflicting goals meaning an acceptable solution for all three needs to be designed carefully.

Regarding (2), we adapt the sorting scheme of Radl and Steiner et al. [2024], which eliminates popping by hierarchically sorting Gaussian contributions per pixel (instead of per primitive) at the cost of increased processing time per Gaussian. Furthermore, by employing a more finely detailed Gaussian densification heuristic [Kerbl et al. 2024; Ye et al. 2024a], we reduce the severity of (3).

This Gaussian renderer is temporally stable also with regards to popping and without underreconstruction artifacts which are noticeable in the periphery. An example rendering can be seen in Fig. 6 (a). Regarding performance, we need to drastically reduce the number of Gaussians (as seen in Tab. 2), which we achieve by limiting the densification during training.

Note that we do not mask out the foveal region in this step and instead generate a full image. Furthermore, we generate an approximate depth buffer [Radl et al. 2024] by accumulating per-pixel

VR-Splatting: Foveated Radiance Field Rendering via 3D Gaussian Splatting and Neural Points

depths 𝑑 for the number of all contributing Gaussian 𝑛 with

$$
d = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} d _ {i} \alpha_ {i} \prod_ {m = 1} ^ {i - 1} (1 - \alpha_ {m}).\tag{1}
$$

While this depth buffer is not needed for the peripheral rendering, it is used to cull occluded points in the following foveal point rendering step.

## 3.3 Foveal Rendering

In our context of foveated rendering, we improve TRIPS [Franke et al. 2024] significantly by using information gained with the previous (full screen) Gaussian rendering results.

Firstly, we only render a subfrustum of the entire scene and discard points outside this frustum as early as possible. This subfrustum is constructed around the fixation point, which is queried from the eye tracker after the periphery has been rendered. Additionally, we use the approximate depth buffer rendered (Eq. 1) from the Gaussians to discard occluded points. This occlusion culling reduces rendering times, accelerates convergence, and eliminates point render flickering, as this simplifies visibility and blending computations.

Furthermore, we inject the fovea crop of the less detailed Gaussian rendering into the CNN. Thus, the network is only tasked with augmenting fine details, instead of balancing hole filling and crisp reconstruction as in TRIPS. As a side product, this severely reduces training cost.

These optimizations allow us to halve the number of filters for the largest-resolution CNN layer to further accelerate our pipeline. Largest-resolution convolutions are originally the most expensive part of the TRIPS network evaluation, taking up more than 70% of the network inference time.

## 3.4 Combination

Our renderer outputs two images 𝑃 (peripheral) and 𝐹 (foveal). It is important to carefully combine both images, as the visual acuity falloff of the human eye is gradual. Therefore, we introduce a combination factor 𝑐 that includes the two terms $f _ { p }$ (positional) and $f _ { e }$ (edge-based) for each pixel (u,v):

$$
r _ {n o r m} = \operatorname{clamp} \left(\frac {1}{d _ {f}} \sqrt {(u - e _ {x}) ^ {2} + (v - e _ {y}) ^ {2}}, 0, 1\right)\tag{2}
$$

$$
f _ {p} = \frac {r _ {n o r m} - m}{1 - m},\tag{3}
$$

with $e _ { x , y }$ being the pixel position of the fixated point, $d _ { f }$ the fovea radius in pixels and 𝑚 the start of the normalized blending interval between 0 and 1. We empirically use $m = 0 . 7 5$ . We use $d _ { f }$ to 256 pixels (see Sec. 4), which is larger than the fovea’s 7% eccentricity, however necessary due to inaccuracies of the eye-tracker.

The second factor is the edge factor $f _ { e }$ , based on the Sobel edge filter 𝑆 of the point image 𝐹 :

$$
f _ {e} = S (F, u, v).\tag{4}
$$

$f _ { e }$ is inspired by Franke et al. [2021], who force color discontinuities in the transition between the fovea and the periphery to be gradual to avoid fast color changes.

Finally, the interpolation factor per pixel 𝑐 is computed as

$$
c = 1 - S _ {2} (f _ {p} + \gamma * f _ {e}),\tag{5}
$$

using $\gamma   =   0 . 2$ and with $S _ { 2 }$ the smootherstep function $S _ { 2 } ( x )   =   6 x ^ { 5 }   -   1 5 x ^ { 4 } + 1 0 x ^ { 3 }$ for a smooth transition and well defined derivations suited for end-to-end training and smooth blending. The

combined image is then computed for each pixel with $( 1 - c ) p + c f$ with 𝑝 and 𝑓 the individual pixels of 𝑃 and 𝐹 .

To account for variance in image exposures, we then follow ADOP [Rückert et al. 2022] and use a differentiable camera model to tone-map the resulting images to a displayable LDR space.

## 3.5 Losses and Optimization

We optimize our pipeline end-to-end. For every iteration, we randomly sample a fixation point and evaluate the pipeline to arrive at a foveated image. We compare this image to the ground truth and optimize via gradient descent using our loss function L:

$$
\mathcal {L} = (1 - \lambda) \mathcal {L} _ {1} + \lambda \mathcal {L} _ {D - S S I M} + \mu \mathcal {L} _ {V G G} (F) + \beta \mathcal {R}\tag{6}
$$

The first two terms are identical to 3DGS [Kerbl et al. 2023] with $\lambda = 0 . 2$ . We further augment this with the VGG19-loss [Ledig et al. 2017] for neural point rendering with $\mu = 0 . 0 0 1$ . VGG-loss has proven to work well for neural point rendering; however, for Gaussian Splatting, it increases convergence time and causes artifacts with densification. Therefore we only apply it to neural point renderings. Lastly, we introduce a regularizer R:

$$
\mathcal {R} = | \overline {{F}} - \overline {{\mathcal {F} (P)}} |,\tag{7}
$$

with the foveal cropping function F. This ensures that the mean of 𝐹 and the part of 𝑃 with pixels inside the fovea are similar. This regularizer is vital to reduce the color shift, which optimizing with VGG loss otherwise induces. We empirically found $\beta = 0 . 0 0 0 0 1$ to work well. Although a slight shift is still present, it isn’t perceived by users.

We apply an opacity penalty to the opacities of both Gaussians and neural points [Franke et al. 2023; Radl et al. 2024], which causes the optimization to discard obsolete primitives.

## 4 Implementation and Optimization Details

We implemented our method in C++ and CUDA, using torch as the automatic gradient framework and followed the framework of Patas [2023] for a Gaussian Splatting implementation and Radl and Steiner et al.’s sorting algorithm [Radl et al. 2024].

Training. For training, we optimize Gaussians for 30000 iterations (as in 3DGS [Kerbl et al. 2023]) and neural points for 30000 additional iterations with fixed Gaussian parameters. For the first 2000 iterations, both systems are trained independently to avoid the faster converging Gaussians to

interfere with neural point optimization. Afterwards, gradients from the foveal rendering are also propagated back to Gaussian parameters except for VGG-loss computations. Sampling a random eye position every iteration maps well to cropped training usually employed with CNNs. After 45000 iterations, we start regularizing the training with R.

For densification, we lower the thresholds compared to 3DGS and use 0.0002 as densification gradient threshold, 200 as densification interval, 0.005 as opacity pruning threshold, and 0.999 as opacity decay every 50 epochs [Radl et al. 2024]. For the scenes we tested, this results in 0.3M to 0.5M Gaussians. For neural points, we impose an opacity gradient penalty of $1 0 ^ { - 8 }$ every update step [Franke et al. 2023], usually resulting in about 5M points.

We uniformly sample fixation points over the image, which is similar to TRIPS using a cropped training regime. The increased iterations hereby also ensure all parts of the scene to receive coverage during training.

Inference. For inference, we adjusted several aspects to VR rendering. We target the HTC Vive Pro Eye, having an eye-tracker capable of updating rates of 120 Hz. We bake all rendering attributes directly into the point cloud, such as opacities, features, and covariances to minimize runtime costs. Furthermore, we delay eye tracking updates until after rendering 𝑃, drastically reducing lag. Also, compute and evaluate all renderings in half-precision and evaluate the network with images for both eyes batched together using cuDNN for acceleration.

For neural point rendering, rendering only the foveal regions allows for algorithmic optimizations with respect to performance: TRIPS originally renders up to eight progressively lower layers individually, first by counting the pixel contributors, then scanning and allocating a buffer for splatting. These steps introduces overhead, which we reduce by combining all layer computations, speeding up the computations by about 2 ms. This requires about four times the GPU memory of the original implementation; however, this is negligible as rendering is limited to the foveal region.

Fovea Size in Pixels. The effective fovea size in pixels required for our formulation necessitates the estimation of pixels per degree of the field of view. This is complicated by the use of distortion lenses [Kreylos 2018] and is rarely accurately reported by headset manufacturers. We follow Kreylos upper limit estimate of 15.7 pixels per degree [Kreylos 2019] for the headsets display system, which worked well in our tests. Related works use fovea sizes between $7 . 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $1 7 ^ { \circ }$ [Franke et al. 2021; Patney et al. 2016; Weier et al. 2016]. Using the latter as the upper limit and the driver-initiated resolution scale of 1.4×, we arrive at a fovea size of around 400 pixels, which we round to 512 pixels (thus $d _ { f } = 2 5 6 )$ for implementation reasons and to combat eye-tracking inaccuracies.

## 5 Evaluation

We evaluate our method on real-world captured scenes; we use the popular MipNeRF-360 dataset [Barron et al. 2022] as well as the intermediate set from Tanks&Temples [Knapitsch et al. 2017].

## 5.1 Rendering Performance

We compare our methods rendering performance with the established NeRF-based approaches FoV-Nerf [Deng et al. 2022], Scene-aware Foveated Neural Radiance Fields [Shi et al. 2024] (SA Fov-Nerf), VR-NeRF [Xu et al. 2023] and HybridNeRF [Turki et al. 2024]. Furthermore, we include the differentiable point rendering techniques TRIPS [Franke et al. 2024] and 3DGS [Kerbl et al. 2023] on which our method is built.

In Tab. 1 we present the results of this overview, measured on a single RTX 4090, with metrics reported by related works [Shi et al. 2024; Turki et al. 2024]. Our performance calculations were performed by rendering in full VR resolution, with the drive- recommended $2 0 1 6 \times 2 2 4 0$ pixels per eye. Our method is the only that surpasses the VR framerate limit of 11.1ms per frame, with

speedups of more than 1.45× compared to the fastest related approach “SA Fov-Nerf", who report their timing only for resolutions of 2.44 megapixel compared to our 4.52 megapixel.

For further evaluation, we also compare to a reduced Gaussian Splatting variant with VR-ready performance using 0.5M primitives (see Fig. 2). We call this variant VRGS, which renders slightly faster than our method (as seen in Tab. 2).

For training speed, we improve drastically on TRIPS (see Tab. 2, right), however, both Gaussian Splatting variants converge faster as no neural network optimization is required.

## 5.2 Quantitative Evaluation

To quantitatively evaluate our method, we compare our method with the mentioned VRGS, our interpretation of a VR-ready version of Gaussian Splatting. Furthermore, we compare against 3DGS [Kerbl et al. 2023] and TRIPS [Franke et al. 2024] as qualitative baselines and closest to our method even though they are not fast enough for VR.

We compare using the common quality metrics $\mathrm { L P P S } _ { \mathrm { V G G } }$ [Zhang et al. 2018], PSNR and SSIM. For these metrics, we only evaluate the foveal region and omit the periphery.

The results are seen in Tab. 2, averaged per dataset. Our experiments show that our method is preferable in the LPIPS metric, which is more perceptually close to the human visual system [Zhang et al. 2018; Zuo and Deng 2023], while being close in the other metrics. Importantly, our method is not subject to popping.

For computing JOD (Just-Objectionable-Difference), we use FovVideoVDP [Mantiuk et al. 2021], which is a perceptional metric that includes terms for contrast sensitivity and peripheral vision. This method is designed and capable of metrically evaluating foveated rendering and scoring it in JOD between 0 and 10, the higher the better. We use it with the preset for the HTC Vive Pro (having the same display system we use) in the setup: "FovVideoVDP v1.2.0, 13.15 [pix/deg], Lpeak=133.3, Lblack=0.1 [cd/m2], foveated". The metric is computed including peripheral regions. As also seen in Tab. $2 ,$ our method consistently outperforms VRGS in this metric.

For VR renderings of our method, see the supplemental video and the project page.

## 5.3 User Study

To further evaluate our method against the VR-ready Gaussian Splatting VRGS, we conducted a user study. In our study design, we follow Deng et al.’s foveated radiance field user study design and evaluation [Deng et al. 2022]. The experiments were approved by an institutional ethical review board.

Fig. 7. Example renderings of the playground, family (upper row), bonsai, and bicycle (lower row) scenes used in the user study.

Stimuli. Each stimulus set comprised VR-ready stereo rendering using both our method and VRGS. The resolution of each image was 2016 × 2240 pixels per eye, and seated free exploration was possible. We used scenes garden, bicycle and bonsai from the MipNeRF-360 dataset [Barron et al. 2022] as well as scenes family and playground from the Tanks&Temples dataset [Knapitsch et al. 2017]. Example renderings are presented in Fig. 7 and in the teaser (Fig. 1).

Setup. Each participant was seated and equipped with an eye-tracked HTC Vive Pro Eye headset to view stimuli throughout the experiment. The eye tracker was calibrated for each participant with the default calibration kit. The users had a keyboard in front of them to switch rendering modes at will as well as to confirm the choices. Participants could switch the rendering mode by pressing the spacebar and confirm their choice with the enter button. In total, twelve users (aged 22 to 30, 4 female, 8 male) participated in the experiment.

Task. The task followed a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) design. Each trial presented a pair of stimuli generated by our method and VRGS, with the order of viewpoints and the first mode displayed being randomized. A mandatory 0.5 second break [Guenter et al. 2012], displaying a gray screen, was introduced between conditions to reset visual perception, with the same applied between different scenes.

Each participant completed 20 trials throughout the experiment. Before the experiment, the participants were briefed and the device was calibrated. During the study, participants were allowed to take as long as needed to complete each test. The participants were unaware of the experimental hypothesis.

Results. Participants in total made 240 decisions, their percentage distributions are shown in Fig. 8. We observe a significantly higher ratio of participants who prefer ours to VRGS (∼ 76% preferred ours, $\overline { { S D } } = 0 . 1 9 6 )$ . Binomial tests showed significance of this with $p < 0 . 0 0 5 .$

In the garden scene, our method was preferred overwhelmingly with over 90%, as our method is able to showcase crisp details accurately (as seen in Fig. 1). The playground scene revealed the lowest preference for our method with 67%, as here the initial viewpoint was further away, making details easier to miss for the participants.

Discussion. The high preference ratio for our method confirms the effectiveness of our method. This is underlined by the comments made by the participants, which highlighted the higher perceived quality and sharpness of our renderings.

## 5.4 Ablation Studies

5.4.1 Performance Ablation. We ablate our rendering performance in Tab. 3, with individual features turned off. Rendering time is evenly split between foveal and peripheral reconstruction (upper part), with peripheral rendering taking 4.9 ms on average.

The enhancements mentioned in Section 3 all improve performance in a measurable way (middle part). Opacity penalty for example increases render times by 2.5 ms, while depth culling slightly lowers peripheral render times at the cost of not culling neural points.

Our introduced quality enhancing features (lower parts) have performance impacts, especially the hierarchical sorting approach to fix popping [Radl et al. 2024]. However, as described in Sec. 3.1, it proved important to perceptual quality.

Fig. 9. Densification strategies. 3DGS-MCMC [Kheradmand et al. 2024] employ an densification scheme up to an exact number of primitives, however their background reconstruction quality is limited compared to ours.

5.4.2 Densification Strategy for Gaussian Splatting. Recently, Kheradmand et al. [2024] introduced a Markov chain-dependent Gaussian Splatting densification scheme, allowing for an exact determi nation of the number of Gaussians. This approach would be preferable since we need to maintain a conservative densification heuristic to prevent exceeding the VR limit.

As shown in Fig. 9, the low amount of primitives still result in great foreground reconstruction, however, deteriorated backgrounds. This introduces severe artifacts in the peripheral reconstruction, including spiky Gaussians with high color variance, which is unsuitable for smooth peripheral rendering. As such we use the heuristic densification strategy.

## 6 Limitations & Future Work

We inherit limitations from both Gaussian Splatting [Kerbl et al. 2023] and TRIPS [Franke et al. 2024]. In particular, we require good capturing densities, as otherwise holes or missing areas are present. Furthermore, we are dependent on COLMAP for SfM/MVS results; otherwise, artifacts due to miscalibrations occur. Slight camera pose errors are optimized by our pipeline; however, severe errors cannot be compensated for.

Our approach and the VRGS Gaussian baseline suffer from floaters which is further enhanced by the low densification thresholds used. Passing through floaters can be perceived as flickering and is distracting in VR. Stronger mitigation methods [Huang et al. 2024b; Philip and Deschaintre 2023] would be beneficial in these cases.

Our hardware also presents challenges. We had to increase the fovea sizes as the eye tracker was inaccurate during the experiments. Better calibrated and more accurate gaze position allow further performance increases with our method.

## 7 Conclusion

In conclusion, our proposed foveated rendering approach demonstrates a viable solution to overcome the computational demand for radiance field rendering in real-time virtual reality systems. By blending high-detail neural point rendering for the foveal region with smooth 3DGS rendering in the periphery, we obtain crisp rendering of radiance fields without compromising system performance. Our hybrid solution meets the performance demands of interactive VR, offering a significant improvement in rendering quality and user experience, which might pave the way for more realistic and immersive VR applications such as video games or virtual tourism.
